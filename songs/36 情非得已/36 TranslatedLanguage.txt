It's hard to forget the first time I met you
A mesmerizing pair of eyes
In my mind
The image of you
Cannot disappear

When I hold your hand and feel your warmth
It's really too much for me to handle
Your innocence
I would like to treasure, when I see you suffering
I will feel sad

I'm just afraid I will fall for you
Dare not let myself get too close
Afraid I've got nothing to offer you
Loving you may require a lot of courage

I'm just afraid I will fall for you
Maybe one day I wouldn't be able to control myself
Thinking of you only hurts myself
I just can't help falling in love with you

It's hard to forget the first time I met you
A mesmerizing pair of eyes
In my mind
The image of you
Cannot disappear

When I hold your hand and feel your warmth
It's really too much for me to handle
Your innocence
I would like to treasure, when I see you suffering
I will feel sad

I'm just afraid I will fall for you
Dare not let myself get too close
Afraid I've got nothing to offer you
Loving you may require a lot of courage

I'm just afraid I will fall for you
Maybe one day I wouldn't be able to control myself
Thinking of you only hurts myself
I just can't help falling in love with you

What is the reason That I meet you again
I really really don't wish to
Fall into the love trap like this

I'm just afraid I will fall for you
Dare not let myself get too close
Afraid I've got nothing to offer you
Loving you may require a lot of courage

I'm just afraid I will fall for you
Maybe one day I wouldn't be able to control myself
Thinking of you only hurts myself
I just can't help falling in love with you

I just can't help falling in love with you
