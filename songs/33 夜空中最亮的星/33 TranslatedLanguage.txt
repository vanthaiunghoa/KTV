The brightest star in the night sky,
can you hear clearly
the solitude and sighing on the bottom of the heart
of that person who looks up at you

The brightest star in the night sky,
can you remember
the shadows once alongside me
on my way which disappeared in the winds
 
I pray for a transparent soul
and eyes that know how to shed tears
Give me the courage to believe again
and cross the lies to embrace you
Whenever I can't find the meaning of existence
whenever I lose myself in the dark night
the brightest star in the night sky
please show me how to approach you
 
The brightest star in the night sky,
do you know
where they are,
the shadows once alongside me on my way
The brightest star in the night sky,
do you care
that bad luck might come before the sunrise
 
I would rather leave all the pain in my heart
than forget your eyes
Give me the courage to believe again
and cross the lies to embrace you
Whenever I can't find the meaning of existence
whenever I lose myself in the dark night
the brightest star in the night sky
please light my way as I progress
 
I pray for a transparent soul
and eyes that know how to shed tears
Give me the courage to believe again
and cross the lies to embrace you
Whenever I can't find the meaning of existence
whenever I lose myself in the dark night
the brightest star in the night sky
please light my way as I progress
