The smell of smoke has filled the air in the stone-grill shop, next door is a National Martial Arts House
The female host in the shop has third grade in cha-dao
The shop-owner who teaches martial arts including the use of fist and feet, practices iron sand palm and Yang style spear
Most skillful with hard style kung-fu, can also do golden bell cover and iron shirt
Being their son, I've been accustomed to it, been deeply influenced since I was a little child
Any sorts of sword, spear or cudgel, I can perform well
The weapon I like most is nunchucks, which has hardness around softness inside
I want to go to Song Shan in He Nan to learn Shaolin and Wudang martial arts

Why (hakka) Why (hakka)
Exhale and inhale fresh air to be free and get comfort in the heart
Why (hakka) Why (hakka)
Sink your breath to Diantian and open your palms
Why (hakka) Why (hakka)
Walk over thousand of miles with sand bags per day
Don't feel strange to see you flying over rooftops and running on walls and be back very quickly

I take one seated position forward, giving out a left hook fist and a right hook fist
The person who would be in danger, if he pisses me off only with one word. It's been recurred.
A cigarette that I have never smoked has been placed for so many years
It's been with me all along

Why (hakka) Why (hakka)
I open governor and conception vessels
Why (hakka) Why (hakka)
The impression of 'sick men of east asia'
Why (hakka) Why (hakka)
Has already been kicked away by me 

Make use of nunchucks 
Make use of nunchucks
A person practicing martial arts must remember the benevolent is invincible
Who is practicing Tai Chi, causing the wind blowing and waves rising
Make use of nunchucks 
Make use of nunchucks 
If I had flying skills to fly over rooftops and run on walls
Being an upright person, who never gives in and is full of righteousness

Beautiful spinning kick
