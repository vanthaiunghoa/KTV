If there's a road that's made only for you
That road is inside your pure heart
Iif you can endure through this pain
Than just put your soul into trusting..



Slowly, slowly, the river flows in me


Longing, waiting more, would we be there?

I would give my whole heart only to you
So that I can feel you always
If you can hold on into it just a bit longer
Than try to put your heart into it



Slowly, slowly, the river flows in me


Longing, waiting more, would we be there?



Slowly, slowly, the river flows in me


Longing, waiting more, would we be there?
