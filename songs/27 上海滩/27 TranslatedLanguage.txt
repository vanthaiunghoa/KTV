Waves upon waves 
For thousands of miles forev’r flew 
Washing the world and its view 
In a murky current hitherto 

Joy or sorrow 
They don’t tell which is false which is true 
Conquest or foil 
They don’t give even a clue 

Say I love you or hate you
Like a river rushing thru
Thousands of bends can’t subdue
I haven’t conquered the strife hereinto 

There’s joy，there’s sorrow 
Even if I can’t tell which’s true 
Let hundreds of ebb and flow
Beat me inside to the ful

Say I love you or hate you
Like a river rushing thru
Thousands of bends can’t subdue
I haven’t conquered the strife hereinto 

There’s joy，there’s sorrow 
Even if I can’t tell which’s true 
Let hundreds of ebb and flow
Beat me inside to the full

Let hundreds of ebb and flow
Beat me inside to the full
