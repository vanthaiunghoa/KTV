Don't say whose fault it is and just make all turn into dust and ashes
All is hard to retrieve except you lay down the burden in the heart
You always love to let the past follow and is afraid of the past wasteful
You always think that if you want to experience life, you should love a few more times

Rather than let you wither in my arms
I would like to let you make mistakes and regret
Let you fly to the world you're dreaming of, leaving me alone and sad
Rather than let you be gaunt in my love
I would like to let you get hurt and cry
Could it be that you can understand the valuable love after experiencing all the pain
